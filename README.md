# MobileWebsite
this is a Basic Mobile Website I made recently to test out the amazon product API and some geolocation features. You can view the page at:

  http://newton.csmcis.net/~jasonmortensen/cis128/jqueryMobile/
  
  
However, since it's not http, you won't be able to view the Google map features in Chrome I've made use of. So use Firefox or another browser if you'd like to see the full website.
